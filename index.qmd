## About Me

I am a bioinformatician with a background in evolutionary biology and biomedical research. I work in the Weissman Lab at the Palliative and Advanced Illness Research Center ([PAIR Center](https://pair.upenn.edu/)) at the University of Pennsylvania, contributing to projects involving the use of electronic health records for understanding asthma in adults.

I have earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology and a Master of Science in Developmental and Reproductive Biology from the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa.

I will be applying to PhD programs in biomedical informatics (or a related field) this Fall 2025. If you're going through the same process or have any advice to share, I'd like to connect!
