## About Me

I am a bioinformatician with a background in evolutionary biology and biomedical research. I currently work in the Weissman Lab at the Palliative and Advanced Illness Research Center ([PAIR Center](https://pair.upenn.edu/)) at the University of Pennsylvania. I currently contribute to projects involving the use of electronic health records for understanding asthma in adults.

I have earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology and a Master of Science in Developmental and Reproductive Biology from the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa.

In my spare time, I like to be outside as much as I can. I currently am learning how to golf and recently went to the 2025 Truist Championship! One day I'll make par!
